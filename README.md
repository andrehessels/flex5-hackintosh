# Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 (15IIL05) Hackintosh
This is a hackintosh project for the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5, which uses OpenCore v0.7.8. Currently, it runs perfectly fine using an external SSD (I'm using the Samsung Portable T7). When trying to install MacOS on the internal SSD, the installer will freeze completely after a couple of minutes (I suspect it has something to do with NVMe).

Not working (yet) - some are easy to fix, others are not:
- External video output (such as HDMI)
- Internal trackpad
- Internal microphone
- Internal SSD

For now, I have only tested my EFI folder in combination with Catalina. However, you should be able to boot all MacOS versions between 10.15.4 to 11.2.3 just fine.
